############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

## The deck is unlimited in size. 
## There are no jokers. 
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

##################### Hints #####################

#Hint 1: Go to this website and try out the Blackjack game: 
#   https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack/
#Then try out the completed Blackjack project here: 
#   http://blackjack-final.appbrewery.repl.run

#Hint 2: Read this breakdown of program requirements: 
#   http://listmoz.com/view/6h34DJpvJBFVRlZfJvxF
#Then try to create your own flowchart for the program.

#Hint 3: Download and read this flow chart I've created: 
#   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rDkiHCrhaf9eX7u7yjM1qwSuyEk-rPnt

#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.
#cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
import random
from replit import clear
from art import logo

def deal_card():
    cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
    card = random.choice(cards)
    return card

#Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input 
#and returns the score. 
#Look up the sum() function to help you do this.
def calculate_score(cards):
    """Take a list of cards and return the score calculated from the cards"""
    #Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.
    if sum(cards) == 21 and len(cards) == 2:
        return 0        
    #Hint 8: Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove().
    if 11 in cards and sum(cards) > 21:
        cards.remove(11)
        cards.append(1)
    
    return sum(cards)

#Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.
def compare(your_score, dealer_score):
    if dealer_score == your_score:
        return "Draw"
    elif dealer_score == 0:
        return "You lose. The dealer has Blackjack"
    elif your_score == 0:
        return "You win with a Blackjack"
    elif your_score > 21:
        return "You lose"
    elif dealer_score > 21:
        return "The dealer is over 21, You win"
    elif your_score > dealer_score:
        return "You win"
    else:
        return "You lose"

def play_game():
    #Hint 5: Deal the user and computer 2 cards each using deal_card() and append().
    #user_cards = []
    #computer_cards = []
    print(logo)
    your_card = []
    dealer_card = []

    for x in range(2):
        your_card.append(deal_card())
        dealer_card.append(deal_card())


    #Hint 11: The score will need to be rechecked with every new card drawn and the checks in Hint 9 need to be repeated until the game ends.
    while not game_over:
        #Hint 9: Call calculate_score(). If the computer or the user has a blackjack (0) or if the user's score is over 21, then the game ends.

        dealer_score = calculate_score(dealer_card)

            game_over = True
        else:
            #Hint 10: If the game has not ended, ask the user if they want to draw another card. If yes, then use the deal_card() function to add another card to the user_cards List. If no, then the game has ended.
            get_card = input("Do you want to draw another card? Type 'y' to draw, and type 'n' to pass: ")
            if get_card == "y":
                your_card.append(deal_card())
            elif get_card == "n":
                game_over = True

    #Hint 12: Once the user is done, it's time to let the computer play. The computer should keep drawing cards as long as it has a score less than 17.
    while dealer_score != 0 and dealer_score < 17:
        dealer_card.append(deal_card())
        dealer_score = calculate_score(dealer_card)

    print(f"\t Your final card: {your_card}, final score: {your_score}")
    print((f"\t Dealer final card: {dealer_card}, final score: {dealer_score}"))
    print(compare(your_score, dealer_score))

#Hint 14: Ask the user if they want to restart the game. If they answer yes, clear the console and start a new game of blackjack and show the logo from art.py.
while input("Do you want to play Blackjack? Type 'y' or 'n': ").lower() == "y":
    clear()
